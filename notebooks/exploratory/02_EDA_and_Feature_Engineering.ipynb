    "This scatter plot displays the relationship between a building’s age and its average electricity use. The points are widely dispersed with no strong linear trend, indicating that building age alone does not reliably predict electricity consumption. While a few older buildings show higher electricity usage, many older buildings fall in the same low-use range as newer ones. There is no clear correlation between building age and electricity usage. Electricity consumption varies substantially across buildings of all ages.This suggests that other factors play a more significant role than age alone such as building size, type, occupancy, HVAC systems or renovations history. This aligns with the expectations, such as some older buildings might have undergone energy efficient retrofits , while some newer buildings may have higher energy loads depending on their uses. In conclusion age alone is not a strong driver of electricity usage and more features should be included in subsequent models."

    "This figure compares examines how square footage relates to mean electricty use. There is a clearer upward trend compared to the age plot, larger buildings tend to use more electrocty especially those above 100,000 sq ft. Although the relationship is noisy, the general pattern suggests that the size is a meaningful predictor of consumption. Electricty use increases with building size, which is expected because larger structures require more heating, cooling, lighting and equipment. This relationship is positive but non linear, small building s cluster tightly near lower electricty values, while larger buildings show much wider variability. The plot shows some existing outliers, such as buildings with very large square footage with relatively low electricity consumption may represent warehouses or low occupancy spaces, while small but high usage buildings may be labs or specialized facilities. In conclusion square footage appears to be much stronger predictor of electricty usage than age, and should be included in the modeling stage. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I conducted a deeper exploratory analysis of the cleaned building electricity dataset and examined how electricity use varies with several key building characteristics. The visualizations showed that building age alone does not strongly influence electricity consumption, while building size (square footage) and building type exhibit clearer relationships. Larger buildings and certain categories such as healthcare, science, and office spaces tend to consume more electricity, highlighting the importance of building function and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also engineered new features, including energy intensity (electricity per square foot) and log transformed electricity usage, which provided additional insight into efficiency differences across building groups. These engineered features will be useful for improving model performance in later analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build on the baseline model from Notebook 1, I fit both a multiple linear regression model and a Random Forest model. The multiple linear regression improved predictive accuracy over the baseline by incorporating building size and type, explaining roughly 18% of the variance in electricity use. The Random Forest model produced slightly lower MAE but a lower R², suggesting limited non-linear structure in the available features. Together, these results indicate that electricity usage is influenced by multiple building level attributes, but additional predictors, such as occupancy, HVAC systems, or operational schedules would be required for substantially higher predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook establishes a solid understanding of the main drivers of electricity usage and creates a modeling ready dataset for further analysis. The next notebook will focus on model interpretation, feature importance, and understanding which building characteristics matter most for electricity prediction.\n"
